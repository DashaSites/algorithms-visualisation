### Algorithm Visualizer

A React + TypeScript project focused on visualizing how classic algorithms and data structures work step by step.

The app includes interactive visualizations for:
- **String reversal** (two-pointer swap logic)
- **Fibonacci sequence** (incremental number generation)
- **Sorting algorithms** (selection and bubble sort)
- **Stack**, **queue**, and **linked list** (insert/delete operations with animation)

Each interaction is animated with simple transitions and color changes to help visualize the algorithmâ€™s logic.

ðŸ“Œ This was part of a training program aimed at deepening understanding of algorithm mechanics through UI implementation â€” not focused on production-level design.
